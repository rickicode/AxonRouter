/**
 * Freebuff — the free, ad-supported coding agent by Codebuff (freebuff.com).
 *
 * The Freebuff CLI (github.com/CodebuffAI/freebuff) is an interactive TUI that
 * talks to the Codebuff/Freebuff backend. Two hosts are involved:
 *   - login flow (freebuff mode) runs on  https://freebuff.com
 *       POST /api/auth/cli/code {fingerprintId} → { loginUrl, fingerprintHash, expiresAt }
 *       open loginUrl in browser, then GET /api/auth/cli/status until {user}.
 *       (The server echoes the request host into loginUrl, so calling
 *       freebuff.com yields freebuff.com/login?auth_code=… exactly like the
 *       official CLI — www.codebuff.com would yield the wrong link.)
 *   - LLM traffic goes to the OpenAI-compatible endpoint on
 *       https://www.codebuff.com/api/v1/chat/completions
 *     (freebuff.com does NOT serve /api/v1/* — it 404s with the SPA shell.)
 *
 * Both hosts share one backend: the authToken obtained via the freebuff.com
 * login validates against www.codebuff.com (Bearer auth). The request body
 * must carry the CLI's `codebuff` provider block
 * (`codebuff_metadata.run_id/client_id/cost_mode`) — injected by
 * executors/freebuff.js. cost_mode:"free" is what admits a session on the free
 * (country-gated, session-limited) tier instead of billing credits.

  // `prices` (model → Freebucks/hr) plus an announced `priceChanges` schedule
  // (promos like Solar Pro 4's Labor Day run expire server-side; see
  // services/usage/freebuff.js which folds both in, exactly like the upstream
  // CLI which hardcodes no number). Plus the capacity-limited Fable trial.
  // deepseek-v4-pro and minimax-m3 were withdrawn upstream (2026-08-26 /

  // z-ai/glm-5.2 is a referral reward (not a free pick), luna-es / kimi-k3-eco

  // all intentionally omitted. Fable is a capacity-limited WAVE trial: sessions
  // only claim while the backend advertises it via limitedModelOffers on the
